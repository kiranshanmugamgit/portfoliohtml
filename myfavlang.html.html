<h1>Most Favourite Programming Language according to KiranShanmugam </h1>
<hr>
<h2>c++</h2>

<h4>why?</h4>

<p><h5>Reason is :</h5>
   <ol>
       <li><h3>Easy to manipulate</h3> Object-Oriented
    C++ is an object-oriented programming language which means that the main focus is on objects and manipulations around these objects. This makes it much easier to manipulate code, unlike procedural or structured programming which requires a series of computational steps to be carried out.</li>
   <li> <h3>Speed</h3>
    When speed is a critical metric, C++ is the most preferred choice. The compilation and execution time of a C++ program is much faster than most general-purpose programming languages.</li>
    
   <li><h3>Compiled</h3>
    Unlike other programming languages where no compilation is required, every C++ code has to be first compiled to a low-level language and then executed.</li>
    
    <li> <h3>Rich Library Support</h3>
    The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) has many functions available to help write code quickly. For example, there are STLs for various containers like hash tables, maps, sets, etc.</li>
    
   <li> <h3>Rich Library Support</h3>
    C++ also supports pointers which are often not available in other programming languages. </li>
    
   <li> <h3>Closer to Hardware</h3>
    C++ is closer to hardware than most general-purpose programming languages. This makes it very useful in those areas where hardware and software are closely coupled together, and low-level support is needed at the software level.</li></ol>
